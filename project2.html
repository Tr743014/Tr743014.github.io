      <h2>Project Description</h2>
      <p>
       Managed the savn.local Active Directory domain as part of a system 
        administration exercise. Tasks included creating organizational units (OUs), 
        generating local and domain user accounts, assigning users to OUs, and managing 
        role-based access. Explored domain login behavior under normal and offline 
        domain controller conditions. Emphasized proper VM management, administrative 
        permissions, and adherence to enterprise-level best practices for user account 
        security and system reliability. Delivered all required screenshots documenting 
        each step, demonstrating practical Active Directory administration skills.
