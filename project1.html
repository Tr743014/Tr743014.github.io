      <h2>Project Description</h2>
      <p>
       Developed a fully functional three-tier web-based application using JSP, servlets, and a MySQL backend. 
       The system supports multiple user roles—root, client, and accountant—each with distinct privileges, 
        including SQL command execution and report generation via stored procedures. Implemented 
        authentication, secure database access via properties files, and server-side business logic for 
        dynamic data updates. This project integrated knowledge from previous assignments in GUI design, 
        Java programming, and database management, culminating in a distributed application demonstrating 
        real-world enterprise workflows.
